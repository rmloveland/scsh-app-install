Scsh Command-Line App Installer
-------------------------------

Public procedures:

+ `(DEPLOY-APP "name")`: This procedure will dump an executable scsh
  image of the currently loaded `MAIN` procedure in
  `$HOME/bin/.${name}/${name}`, and create a symlink to that image
  called `$HOME/bin/${name}`, so you can run it from the shell.

Example:

    > ; From the scsh REPL
	> (deploy-app "metaprinter")
	Channel closed in dumped image: standard input
	Channel closed in dumped image: standard output
	Channel closed in dumped image: standard error
	Writing /Users/rloveland/bin/.metaprinter/metaprinter

    $ # From the shell
    $ metaprinter 
    Usage: metaprinter --{std,rpt} SERVICE
