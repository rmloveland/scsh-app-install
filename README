Scsh Command-Line App Installer
===============================

Utility code for easily generating and installing a standalone
command-line "app" written in scsh.  The app is installed in its own
directory under `$HOME/bin/.${app-name}` where it can include
arbitrary config files, data, etc.

Behind the scenes, this is all just to automate:

+ loading the app's main procedure
+ dumping an image file procedure
+ linking the whole mess and making it executable.


Public procedures
-----------------

+ `(DEPLOY-APP! PROC "app-name")`: This procedure will dump an
  executable scsh image of the currently loaded main procedure *PROC*
  in `$HOME/bin/.${app-name}/${app-name}`, and create a symlink to
  that image called `$HOME/bin/${app-name}`, so you can run it from
  the shell.  Since *PROC* is the main driver procedure that parses
  the command line, it must take a single list argument, by convention
  known as *PROG+ARGS*.  Note that this procedure is **destructive**,
  that is, it will overwrite the previous scsh image file and symlink.


Example
-------

    > ; From the scsh REPL

    > ,config ,load /Users/rloveland/Code/scsh-app-install/interfaces.scm
    > ,config ,load /Users/rloveland/Code/scsh-app-install/packages.scm
    > ,open app-install
    > ,bound? deploy-app
    Bound to #(#{Type :value #f #f} #{Location 9385 deploy-app app-install} #f)

    > (deploy-app main "metaprinter")
	Channel closed in dumped image: standard input
	Channel closed in dumped image: standard output
	Channel closed in dumped image: standard error
	Writing /Users/rloveland/bin/.metaprinter/metaprinter

    $ # From the shell
    $ metaprinter 
    Usage: metaprinter --{std,rpt} SERVICE
