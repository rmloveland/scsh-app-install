Scsh Command-Line App Installer
-------------------------------

+ `(DEPLOY-APP "name")`: This procedure will dump an executable scsh
  image of the currently loaded procedure called `MAIN` in your
  `$HOME/bin/.${name}/${name}` folder, and create a symlink to the
  executable scsh image in `$HOME/bin/${name}`.

Example:

	> (deploy-app "metaprinter")
	Channel closed in dumped image: standard input
	Channel closed in dumped image: standard output
	Channel closed in dumped image: standard error
	Writing /Users/rloveland/bin/.metaprinter/metaprinter
	>
