Scsh Command-Line App Installer
-------------------------------

Utility code for easily generating and installing a standalone
command-line app written in scsh.  The app is installed in its own
directory under `$HOME/bin/.${app-name}` where it can include
arbitrary config files, data, etc.

Public procedures:

+ `(DEPLOY-APP PROC "app-name")`: This procedure will dump an
  executable scsh image of the currently loaded main procedure *PROC*
  in `$HOME/bin/.${app-name}/${app-name}`, and create a symlink to
  that image called `$HOME/bin/${app-name}`, so you can run it from
  the shell.  Since *PROC* is the main driver procedure that parses
  the command line, it must take a single list argument, by convention
  known as *PROG+ARGS*.  Note that this procedure is **destructive**,
  that is, it will overwrite the previous scsh image file and symlink.

Example:

    > ; From the scsh REPL
	> (deploy-app main "metaprinter")
	Channel closed in dumped image: standard input
	Channel closed in dumped image: standard output
	Channel closed in dumped image: standard error
	Writing /Users/rloveland/bin/.metaprinter/metaprinter

    $ # From the shell
    $ metaprinter 
    Usage: metaprinter --{std,rpt} SERVICE
